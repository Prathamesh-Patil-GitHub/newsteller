You can choose any topic on which you want to read the news.<br/>

You can also read news of the countries you are interested in, as NewsTeller supports <b>over 50+ countries.</b><br/><br/>
As I have used React Router, this is a single page application, No reloading hectic :)

You can also save news of your choice into your account to access them later, you have to Sign Up or Log In to do so.
